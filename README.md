Ghostwriter is designed to be a Mobile-to-Desktop remote mouse application. It is essentially still in a prototype state and only supports BlackBerry to Windows.

Ghostwriter utilizes the Metova Mobile SDK for a large amount of the base code. Without this SDK and Maven plugin you will not be able to build the project.

Ghostwriter consists of three projects:  
[ghostwriter-bb](https://github.com/MartinMReed/ghostwriter-bb)  
[ghostwriter-server](https://github.com/MartinMReed/ghostwriter-server)  
[ghostwriter-core](https://github.com/MartinMReed/ghostwriter-core)
